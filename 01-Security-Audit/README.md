# Security Audit Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive security audit conducted for Botium Toys, a growing toy company expanding its online presence domestically and internationally. The audit was performed to identify and address potential security risks, compliance issues, and vulnerabilities as the company scales its operations.

## Company Background
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys with:
- A single physical location serving as their main office, storefront, and warehouse
- Growing online presence attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad
- IT department under increasing pressure to support worldwide online market

## Audit Scope and Goals
**Scope:** The entire security program at Botium Toys, including:
- Employee equipment and devices
- Internal network
- Systems
- Controls and compliance practices

**Goals:** Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys' security posture.

*The complete scope, goals, and risk assessment document used to complete the controls and compliance checklist is available in the [reference-documents](./reference-documents) folder.*

## Current Assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include:
- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
- Employee equipment (desktops/laptops, smartphones, remote workstations, peripherals)
- Storefront products (retail and online)
- Management systems (accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, inventory)
- Internet access
- Internal network
- Data retention and storage
- Legacy system maintenance

## Risk Assessment Findings
The risk assessment identified several critical security concerns:
- Risk score of 8/10 (high) due to lack of controls and compliance adherence
- Inadequate management of assets
- Potentially non-compliant with U.S. and international regulations
- Unrestricted internal data access for all employees
- Lack of encryption for customer credit card information
- Missing access controls (least privilege and separation of duties)
- No intrusion detection system
- Absence of disaster recovery plans and critical data backups
- Weak password policies and management
- Irregular legacy system maintenance

Some existing controls include:
- Firewall with appropriate security rules
- Antivirus software with regular monitoring
- GDPR breach notification procedures (72-hour notice to EU customers)
- Physical security controls (locks, CCTV, fire systems)

## Project Deliverables
This folder contains:
- **Controls and Compliance Checklist**: My detailed analysis and recommendations for Botium Toys' security controls across multiple domains including administrative, technical, and physical controls, with assessments for PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC2 compliance
- **Scope Document**: Provides context for the audit including scope, goals, and risk assessment findings

## Skills Demonstrated
- Application of NIST CSF to a practical business scenario
- Security controls assessment and gap analysis
- Regulatory compliance evaluation (PCI DSS, GDPR)
- Risk identification and prioritization
- Security documentation and reporting

## Methodology
This security audit followed the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), focusing on the five core functions:
1. **Identify** - Asset management and classification
2. **Protect** - Access controls, data security, maintenance
3. **Detect** - Monitoring and detection processes
4. **Respond** - Response planning and communications
5. **Recover** - Recovery planning and improvements

This project illustrates my ability to conduct thorough security audits, evaluate compliance requirements, and provide actionable recommendations to improve an organization's security posture.
