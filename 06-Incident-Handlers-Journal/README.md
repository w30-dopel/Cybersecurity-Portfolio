# Incident Handler's Journal

## Project Overview
This project presents my incident handler's journal containing structured documentation of four distinct security incidents. Throughout my cybersecurity coursework, I've created detailed journal entries that demonstrate my ability to analyze, document, and respond to different types of security events using industry-standard frameworks and methodologies.

## Purpose of an Incident Handler's Journal
An incident handler's journal is a critical tool for cybersecurity professionals to:
- Document security incidents in a structured, consistent manner
- Track incident response activities and their outcomes
- Capture technical details for future reference and pattern recognition
- Aid in knowledge transfer between security team members
- Identify areas for improvement in security processes

## Project Components
This project folder contains:

- **Incident_Handlers_Journal.pdf**: A comprehensive document containing four detailed security incident entries:
  - Entry #1: Ransomware incident at a healthcare clinic
  - Entry #2: Phishing attack with malicious file attachment at a financial services company
  - Entry #3: Suricata IDS rule configuration and testing
  - Entry #4: Analysis of a data breach final report for a retail company

## Incident Entries Overview

### Entry #1: Ransomware Attack on Healthcare Clinic
Analysis of a ransomware attack targeting a small U.S. healthcare clinic, documenting how threat actors used phishing emails to deploy malware that encrypted critical files including medical records. The entry examines containment, eradication, and recovery phases, with preventative recommendations spanning managerial, operational, technical controls, and HIPAA compliance considerations.

### Entry #2: Malicious File Analysis with VirusTotal
Documentation of a security incident at a financial services company where an employee received a password-protected attachment containing malicious code. The entry focuses on analyzing the file's hash using VirusTotal and identifying indicators of compromise (IoCs) through the Pyramid of Pain framework.

### Entry #3: Suricata IDS Configuration and Testing
Exploration of Suricata intrusion detection system configuration, rule creation, and testing. This entry documents the process of creating custom Suricata rules to detect specific patterns in network traffic, testing them against a packet capture file, and analyzing the resulting alert logs in both fast.log and eve.json formats.

### Entry #4: Data Breach Report Analysis
Review of a final incident report for a major data theft incident at a retail company involving 50,000 customer records. The entry identifies the vulnerability exploited (forced browsing), analyzes the company's response actions, and evaluates the recommendations implemented to prevent similar incidents, with a focus on access control mechanisms and vulnerability scanning.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Incident documentation using the 5 W's methodology
- Security event analysis across varied incident types
- Tool utilization (VirusTotal, Suricata IDS)
- Root cause analysis
- Security control recommendations
- Post-incident analysis and lessons learned

## Tools and Methodologies Used
- Structured incident documentation frameworks
- NIST Incident Response Lifecycle
- VirusTotal for malware analysis
- Suricata IDS for network security monitoring
- Pyramid of Pain for IoC classification
- Root cause analysis techniques

## Reflections and Professional Growth
The journal concludes with personal reflections on the learning process, challenges encountered, and evolving understanding of incident detection and response. These reflections demonstrate growth in technical skills, appreciation for post-incident activities, and enthusiasm for collaborative security tools like VirusTotal.

This project showcases my ability to handle diverse security incidents in a methodical, thorough manner while maintaining clear documentation throughout the response process - a valuable skill set for cybersecurity professionals.
