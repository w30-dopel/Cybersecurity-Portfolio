# Linux File Permissions Management

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the principle of least privilege through Linux file permission management. As a security professional working with a research team, I was tasked with examining and modifying file permissions to ensure appropriate authorization while maintaining system security.

## Scenario
I acted as a security professional at a large organization, primarily working with their research team. My responsibility included ensuring users on this team were authorized with appropriate permissions to maintain system security. The task involved examining existing permissions on the file system, determining if they matched required authorization levels, and modifying permissions as needed to authorize appropriate users while removing unauthorized access.

## Project Components
This project folder contains:

- **Linux_Permissions_Management.pdf**: A comprehensive document showing:
  - Commands used to examine file permissions
  - Explanations of permission interpretation
  - Step-by-step process of modifying permissions
  - Before and after permission states
  - Implementation of security best practices

The **Original_File_Permissions.pdf** document, showing the initial file permissions that needed to be analyzed and modified, is available in the [reference-documents](./reference-documents) folder.


## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux command line operations
- File permission interpretation
- Permission modification using chmod
- Hidden file management
- Implementation of the principle of least privilege
- Security hardening

## Tools Used
- Linux command line interface
- ls command with -l and -a flags (for examining permissions)
- chmod command (for modifying permissions)

## Key Security Concepts Applied
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensuring users have only the permissions necessary for their role
- **Authorization Management**: Correctly assigning read, write, and execute permissions
- **System Hardening**: Removing excessive permissions to reduce attack surface
- **Directory Security**: Properly managing permissions for directories
- **Hidden File Security**: Properly managing permissions for hidden files

This project showcases fundamental Linux security skills essential for maintaining secure systems across enterprise environments.
