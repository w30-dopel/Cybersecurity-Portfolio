# Vulnerability Assessment for Small Business

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive vulnerability assessment for a small e-commerce business with a public-facing database server. As a cybersecurity analyst, I identified critical security vulnerabilities, assessed potential risks, and developed a detailed remediation plan to protect the organization's sensitive data and business operations.

## Scenario
Working as a cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company, I discovered that their database server—which contains customer and business information—had been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. Employees worldwide regularly query this database to access customer information. Recognizing this as a serious security vulnerability, I conducted a thorough vulnerability assessment to communicate the risks to decision-makers and recommend security controls.

## Assessment Methodology
I applied the NIST SP 800-30 framework to structure my vulnerability assessment, following these key steps:
1. Identifying threat sources (human and technological)
2. Cataloging potential threat events
3. Evaluating likelihood of threat events
4. Assessing potential impact severity
5. Determining overall risk levels
6. Developing appropriate mitigation strategies

## Project Components
This project folder contains:

- **Vulnerability_Assessment_Report.pdf**: A comprehensive document showing:
  - Detailed vulnerability analysis of the public-facing database
  - Risk assessment using structured methodology
  - Potential impacts to business operations
  - Prioritized remediation recommendations

The **NIST_SP_800-30_Rev_1.pdf** reference document outlining the risk assessment framework used for this analysis can be found in the [reference-documents](./reference-documents) directory.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Vulnerability identification and analysis
- Risk assessment application
- Threat modeling
- Security control recommendations
- Technical documentation for executive stakeholders
- Remediation planning and prioritization

## Tools Used
- NIST SP 800-30 Risk Assessment Framework
- Threat source and event categorization
- Qualitative and quantitative risk analysis
- Risk scoring methodology
- Remediation planning techniques

## Key Security Analysis Findings
This vulnerability assessment identified several critical risks associated with the public-facing database:
- Potential unauthorized access to sensitive customer data
- Risk of data exfiltration by malicious actors
- Exposure to various attack vectors (SQL injection, DoS attacks)
- Compliance violations related to data protection regulations
- Potential business disruption and reputational damage

The assessment provides a detailed remediation roadmap prioritized by risk level, demonstrating the ability to translate technical vulnerabilities into business risk terms that decision-makers can understand and act upon.

This project showcases my ability to identify vulnerabilities in information systems, assess their potential impact on business operations, and develop practical security recommendations aligned with industry standards.
